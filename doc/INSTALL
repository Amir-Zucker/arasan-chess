Build & install instructions for Arasan on Linux or Mac:

Syzygy tablebase support is enabled by default.

If you want Nalimov or Gaviota tablebase support, you must download
and install the tablebase code (available from
http://arasanchess.org/downld.shtml) and edit the Makefile to select
the type(s) of tablebase support you want and to point to the
necessary sources.

Arasan now requires a modern compiler with C++11 features (although
not necessarily complete C++11 support). Gcc 4.7 or above is
recommended for building Arasan (on Mac OS, use clang).

There is a makefile in the src directory. In most cases, just typing
"make" should automatically select the correct target architecture and
OS (note: assumes target and host are the same). By default it builds
all executables. All binaries are placed in the "bin" subdirectory.

To select the Intel compiler instead of gcc, define the variable CC with
this command:

export CC=icc

"clang" is also supported (set CC=clang to use).

If you have a processor that supports the amd64 POPCNT hardware
instruction, you can build a version of Arasan that uses that by
typing "make popcnt" (works only on a 64-bit OS).

If you want to use PGO to build the arasan engine (arasanx), do:

make clean profiled

(use popcnt-profiled instead of profile as the target for a POPCNT
enabled PGO build).

The Arasan engine binary is named "arasanx-32", "arasanx-64", or
"arasanx-64-popcnt", depending on the architecture and build flags
used.

Limited testing has been done on architectures other than x32 and amd64.
However, the code is believed to be portable. Two non-Intel targets are
defined in the Makefile: sparc-solaris (with gcc as compiler) and
arm-linux.

"make release" will build the release tarball and place it in the
release subdirectory. This target uses "git archive" so it needs to
be run from within a git repository.

"make install" will install Arasan binaries into /usr/local/bin/arasan-20.0.0.
(You will need to be root, or use sudo, to execute "make install").
