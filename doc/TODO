5. change reduction/pruning based on node type - does not work so far.

6. Book learning. Dropout expansion? Implement aa sytem for learning from self-play games.

7. Further LazySMP improvements:
   a. see http://www.tckerrigan.com/Chess/Parallel_Search/Simplified_ABDADA/
   b. improve thread depth distribution logic, see: http://talkchess.com/forum3/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=68154. - done, needs more testing though.

9. Windows GUI badly needs a rewrite, better graphics.

10. Make logging work properly under UCI.

11. Implement position learning in UCI mode.

12. Code cleanup: most of HCE is no longer used so could be removed, as could tuning support.

13. Remove arasan.rc, just use CECP/UCI options as most programs do.
