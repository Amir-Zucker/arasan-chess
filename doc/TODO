post 21.0

Android build, support cross-compilation

Revisit IID conditions
Consider IID even when hash move is present but depth is low (Gull)

singular extensions

implement UCI_Opponent

change reduction/pruning based on node type
change pruning based on "improving" test (Stockfish)
       - neither works so far (but improving status used for LMR now)

New book format? (
LMBD - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_Memory-Mapped_Database.
Or LevelDB, RocksDB).

Book learning. Dropout expansion?

Allow tuner to use mini-batches

losses on time - tune time mgmt when very near time limit

Further LazySMP improvements
http://www.tckerrigan.com/Chess/Parallel_Search/Simplified_ABDADA/

for NUMA: memory striping for hash. Rebind memory on thread resize

pin-aware SEE (Stockfish idea)
https://github.com/mcostalba/Stockfish/commit/90ce24b11ea080f923e1b5d37470e2ca98f4d98b

Consider L1 regularization for tuner, possibly with smooth approximation (http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~gfung/GeneralL1/L1_approx_bounds.pdf)

Properly implement ordinal logistic regression in tuner. Consider using all-threshold as in Rennie paper.
http://ttic.uchicago.edu/~nati/Publications/RennieSrebroIJCAI05.pdf

Improve nps on high core counts (like TCEC). One sub-project of this is
to improve thread depth distribution logic, see:
