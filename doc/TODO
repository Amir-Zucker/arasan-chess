1. Produce a signed M1 executable for Mac

2. FRC

3. implement UCI_Opponent

4. change reduction/pruning based on node type - does not work so far.

5. Book learning. Dropout expansion? Implement aa sytem for learning from self-play games.

6. Further LazySMP improvements:
   a. see http://www.tckerrigan.com/Chess/Parallel_Search/Simplified_ABDADA/
   b. improve thread depth distribution logic, see: http://talkchess.com/forum3/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=68154. - done, needs more testing though.

7. for NUMA: consider memory striping for hash. Rebind memory on thread resize.

8. Windows GUI badly needs a rewrite, better graphics.

9. Code cleanup: most of HCE is no longer used so could be removed, as could tuning support.
