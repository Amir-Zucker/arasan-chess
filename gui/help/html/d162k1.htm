<A NAME="d162k1"></A><H1>Game Menu</H1>

<H2>Go (Compute Move)</H2>
<p>If the computer is calculating a move, this menu selection interrupts the search and forces the computer to move immediately.  If it is not the computer's turn to move, then this menu selection will cause the program to calculate and play a move.  By selecting Go repeatedly, you can cause the program to play a game against itself.</P>
<H2>Take back move</H2>
<p>Undoes the most recently made move.</p>
<H2>Forward 1 move</H2>
<P>After one or more moves have been taken back, you can replay those moves by selecting Forward 1 move from the menu.  Also, this is the command you would use to replay moves from a game that has been read in from a PGN file.</P>
<H2>Beginning of game</H2>
<P>If you are playing or viewing a game, this command will “take back” all the moves up to the start of the game, so that you can play it over from the beginning.</P>
<H2>End of game</H2>
<P>This command moves forward through the game moves until it reaches the final board position in the game, which will be displayed. You can step backwards through the game by using the take back move command.</P>
<H2>Give Hint</H2>
<P>This command causes the computer to generate a list of moves, either from the opening book or from a brief search. A dialog is then presented that will allow you to choose a move from the list.  Caution: because only a short search is done, the "hint" move that the computer chooses may not be the best move on the board, and may even be a weak move or a blunder.  Use it with care.</P>
<H2>Computer Plays White</H2>
<P>This command is a toggle.  If the check mark is on next to the menu item, then the computer is playing White - selecting the menu item will cause the computer to play the Black pieces instead.  If the check mark is not on, then the computer is playing Black and selecting the menu will cause it to play White.</P>
<H2>Rotate board</H2>
<P>This rotates the board display without changing the side whose turn it is to move, or the side that the computer is playing.</P>
<H2>Show game moves</H2>
<P>Displays a list of all the moves made in the game so far.</P>
